Everything that could've gone wrong for the expo went wrong, but things still came out better than expected. I was absent on the day to make expo elevator pitch, so I didn't have an elevator pitch for the judges. On the day of the expo I was an hour late because I completley forgot you had to get there earlier than normally. And finally the laptop I had to show the [project](https://davidg7188.github.io/sep11-freedom-project/) cropped it so only a portion of it was visible. These gauntlet of challenges had to be overcome on the spot.

Because I was late the judges had already passed my group, but since the expo went on for 2 periods, there was more than enough time for them to pass by again. For the lack of elevator pitch, I asked people who already went for tips some even helped me create an elevator pitch. My project being cropped was not ideal, but the most important factor, the 2 characters, both still appeared on screen. The background image and healthbars not being fully visible wasn't a problem. When it was time to present, I used the tips, parts of the pitch made for me, and improvising on the spot for the judges. It was over quick, and they even had some positive comments.

There are lots of takeaways for that day. Catch up on everything you missed, make a greater effort to not forget things like making a not on a calendar for example, and finally the same takewaway I had from the freedom project, which is to ADAPT.

I am in the 8th and final step for EDP (Engineering Design Process), communicating the results. Both the in class presentation and expo were to show and communicate to people my finished project. It was also to communicate the challenges and takeaways from my time working on this. Skills I used were problem decomposition and creativity. I was still encountering problems even in the final step of EDP, I had to break these problems down and take them on one at a time. To solve these problems I had to get creative and quickly.
